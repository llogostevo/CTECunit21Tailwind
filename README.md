### Setting Up Your Environment

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account using your **school email address**.
- Using a school email will grant you access to free GitHub features through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).


#### Step 3: Fork the Repository
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository you want to fork.  
   i.e: [llogostevo/CTECunit21Tailwind](https://github.com/llogostevo/CTECunit21Tailwind).

2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page.

3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork. GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account.


#### Step 4: Open the Repository in a Codespace
- On your repository page, click the **Code** button, then select **Codespaces** and create a new Codespace. This sets up a cloud-based development environment for you.
