### Setting Up Your Environment

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account using your **school email address**.
- Using a school email will grant you access to free GitHub features through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

#### Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Once logged in, click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
2. Give your repository a name (e.g., `unit21-website`).
3. Check the box to **Add a README file**.
4. Click **Create repository**.

#### Step 3: Open the Repository in a Codespace
- On your repository page, click the **Code** button, then select **Codespaces** and create a new Codespace. This sets up a cloud-based development environment for you.

#### Step 4: Clone the Template Repository
1. In the Codespace terminal, clone this template repository by typing:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/their-repository-name.git
   cd their-repository-name
    ```

### Working on Your Project

#### Making Changes
- Open the `index.html` file and start editing to customize your site.
- You can view your site by opening the file in a browser.

#### Committing and Pushing Changes
Every time you make changes (e.g., after each lesson):

1. Add all changes to the staging area:
   ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Write a message here about what youâ€™ve done"
    git push
```
